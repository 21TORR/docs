Previously we have written our docs in REsT and hosted them on [Read the Docs](https://21torr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
As our tech stack diverges from Python and to ease maintenance, we move them over to Docusaurus.

:::info
The new url is **[21torr-docs.fly.dev](https://21torr-docs.fly.dev/)**.
:::

Code + docs are hosted [on Github](https://github.com/21TORR/docs).
