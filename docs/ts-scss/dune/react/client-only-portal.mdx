# Client Only Portal

The ClientOnlyPortal is a React portal, that is only rendered on the client.
On the server it will render to `null`.

```tsx
import {ClientOnlyPortal} from "@21torr/dune/react/components/Structure/ClientOnlyPortal.js";

<ClientOnlyPortal>
	<div>My content</div>
</ClientOnlyPortal>
```

You can pass an explicit `container` prop, to specify in which element the portal should point to.
By default, the `<body>` is used.
