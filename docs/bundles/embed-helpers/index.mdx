# Embed Helpers

The embed helpers bundle is a Symfony bundle that helps dealing with platform that allow embedding content (like video platforms).


## Installation

```bash
composer req 21torr/embed-helpers
```

## Usage

Right now, only the video platforms integration is implemented.


### Video Platforms

You can fetch the `VideoUrlParser` service to parse video URLs and get details about the video:


```php
public function myAction (VideoUrlParser $videoUrlParser)
{
    $details = $videoUrlParser->parseVideoUrl("https://www.youtube.com/...");
}
```


The details include:

```php
$video->id // the video id
$video->platform // the platform where this video is hosted (currently Vimeo and YouTube only)
$video->videoTyp // the type of the video

$details->getEmbedUrl() // will give you the normalized embed URL to use this video in your app
```

The video types will be one of
- `"short"` for a YouTube shorts URL
- `"video"` for all other recognized video URLs
