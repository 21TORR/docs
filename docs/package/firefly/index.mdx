**Firefly** is the (frontend) build system for assets. It has support for

- building TypeScript / JavaScript
- building SCSS
- building JSX (in Preact)
- linting via Stylelint and ESLint

and unifies the workflow and linting rules across all our projects.

## Installation

Install Firefly locally in your project:

```bash
pnpm i -D @21torr/firefly
```

You can now either call it directly via

```bash
pnpm firefly
```

or use it in scripts in your `package.json`.


## CLI

Firefly is a CLI tool.
All builds will include sourcemaps.

```bash
pnpm firefly [command]
```

You can add the option `--verbose` option to any command, to show verbose
errors from the builder itself (build errors will always be verbose).

Here is an overview of all supported commands:


### `build`

```bash
pnpm firefly build
```

Builds a debug build, including source maps and automatically fixing code style issues.

:::tip
This is the default command, so you can omit the `build` from the call:

```bash
pnpm firefly
```
:::


### `dev`

```bash
pnpm firefly dev
```

Builds a debug build and starts watcher that will continuously build debug
builds as soon as a file changed.

:::tip
Hit `Strg+C` to exit the watcher.
:::


### `ci`

```bash
pnpm firefly ci
```

Builds a debug build (without starting a watcher), but won't run any fixers.
The return code can be used in the CI to fail the build.

Use this in the CI.


### `release`

```bash
pnpm firefly release
```

Will build a production release. It will include source maps, minify all code, but won't lint or fix the code.

Use this on the production / staging server.


### `init`

```bash
pnpm firefly init
```

Will initialize the common configuration files, that you need for (nearly) every Firefly project.
Use this locally to initialize the project. Then adapt the files and commit them to the repository.
