# Umbrella

**Umbrella** is a template preview library, that eases implementation and testing of templates. It is a Symfony bundle.

## Installation

```bash
composer require 21torr/umbrella
```

Add the package config:

```yaml title="config/packages/umbrella.yaml"
umbrella:
	assets:
		# load your assets here, for example via the assets bundle
		- '@app/css/app.css'
```

Add the route config:

```yaml title="config/routes/umbrella.yaml"
_import.umbrella:
	resource: "@UmbrellaBundle/config/routes.yaml"
	prefix: /_layout
```

:::info
In production you should always disable the whole bundle (only enable it in `dev`) â€“ as the templates
should not be publicly visible.

## Including Other Components

You can include other components in your component.

```twig title="atom/button.html.twig"
<button type="button" class="button {{ type ?? "" }}">{{ label ?? "My Button" }}</button>
```

and then use it in your other component:

```twig title="molecule/form.html.twig"
<form class="form">
	{# ... #}

	<div class="form-buttons">
		{{ umbrella("atom", "button", {label: "Submit form") }}
	</div>
</form>
```

You can also pass variables to your component as seen above:

```twig
{# without variables #}
{{ umbrella("atom", "button") }}

{# with variables #}
{{ umbrella("atom", "button", {label: "ohai", type: "is-primary") }}
```

## Variations

Most of the time, you have some variables in your templates to modify the behavior. You can then add a "variations"
template to have a quick look on all supported variations:

With this base component:

```twig title="atom/_button.html.twig"
<button type="button" class="button {{ type ?? "" }}">{{ label ?? "My Button" }}</button>
```

You can then render all your variations like this:

```twig title="atom/buttons.html.twig"
{{ umbrella_variations("atom", "_button", {
	type: ["", "is-primary", "is-muted"],
	label: [null, "Some special label"],
}) }}
```

This will render every combination of every `type` combined with every `label` in this screen.

:::tip
It might be helpful to only have the variations template visible to the user of umbrella and hide the main
`button` template. That's why it is prefixed with an `_`.
