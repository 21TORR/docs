# Security

## Abilities

Abilities act liker roles, but start with a `CAN_` prefix.
The main idea is that the app only checks abilities and roles (`ROLE_*`) only combine abilities and other roles (via the role hierarchy).

The RAD bundle provides automatic integration of security voters to support `CAN_` abilities.
