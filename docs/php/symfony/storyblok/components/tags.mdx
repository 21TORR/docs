# Tags

When using `BlokField`s or `LinkField`s, you regularly want to restrict the selection of the components / stories to sepcific types.

While Storyblok allows to use the component groups for that, they are heavily limited: every component can only
by added to a single group.

That is the reason this bundle adds another layer: **tags**.


## ComponentTag

It is **heavily recommended** to add a single project-wide `ComponentTag` enum to use for defining component tags.

As these tags are only used inside your app, Storyblok knows nothing of them. The bundle transforms all tags to a list of
component keys before interacting with the API. This list is automatically deduplicated.


```php
enum ComponentTag : string
{
	case AccordionBlock = "accordion";
	case BLOCK = "block";
	case SomeOtherTag = "some-other-tag";
}
```

The enum needs to be backed. The actual values don't matter, they only need to be unique.



## Component Filter

Every component can have multiple tags (or none), by implementing the `getTags()` method:

```php
class ExampleComponent extends AbstractComponent
{
	public function getTags () : array
	{
		return [
			ComponentTag::Block,
			ComponentTag::AccordionBlock,
			ComponentTag::SomeOtherTag,
		];
	}
}
```

Then, when implementing for example a `BloksField`, you can filter the components for this tag:

```php
use Torr\Storyblok\Field\Definition\BloksField;

protected function configureFields () : array
{
	return [
		"content" => new BloksField(
			"Content",
			allowedComponents: ComponentFilter::tags(ComponentTag::Block, ComponentTag::Test),
		),
	];
}
```

You can either use the static helper `::tags()` or `::keys()` to pass tags / component keys exclusively.
If you need to pass a combination, manually pass them in the constructor.
