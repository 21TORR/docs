# Recommended Directory Structure

```text
src/
  └─ Storyblok/
     ├─ Api/
     ├─ Component/
     │  ├─ Block/
     │  ├─ Document/
     │  ├─ Story/
     │  ├─ Widget/
     │  ├─ ComponentGroup.php
     │  └─ ComponentTag.php
     └ Field/
        └─ Composite/
```

Comments:

- Add a single project-wide enum to group all component groups and tags.
- Put all standalone components into `Document/` and (as needed) their stories in `Story/`.
- Put all nested components into either `Block/` or `Widget/` (or a different namespace, if fitting).
- You can add a `Composite/` directory for your composite fields.
