# Components

Storyblok works and looks like a virtual filesystem. You can have folders and documents inside of them.
Components define the structure of the content of these documents and are the building block of content in Storyblok.


:::tip
This article talks about a lot of different classes. Take a look at the [recommended directory structure](recommended-directory-structure) before diving into the specifics.
:::


## Component Types

Every component in Storyblok is either

- a **standalone component**. These are components that can be added to the folders as documents.
- a **nested component**. These are components that can only act as nested content in other documents, but not be added to a folder directly.
- a **universal component**. These are components that can be added both directly to folders, but also nested into other components. These are practically never used.


## Naming Convention

Standalone components are named **documents**. They often have no suffix in their class name.

Nested components can have multiple naming schemas, depending on their usage. Normally they also have a class name suffix.

- `*Block` for blocks
- `*Widget` for small and universally used elements like `LinkWidget` (with link and label).
- `*Item` / `*Entry` used for slider entries.


:::info
To ease the reading of this guide, it will keep referring to **documents** (= standalone components) and **bloks** (= nested components) from now on.

## Defining Components

The first step to having components in Storyblok is to define the structure of them. You start by extending `AbstractComponent`:

```php
use Torr\Storyblok\Component\AbstractComponent;
use Torr\Storyblok\Component\Config\ComponentType;
use Torr\Storyblok\Field\Definition\LinkField;
use Torr\Storyblok\Field\Definition\TextField;

final class ButtonComponent extends AbstractComponent
{
	/**
	 * A unique key to identify this component. It is used in Storyblok as well,
	 * so it needs to be unique there too, if you have components
	 * not managed by this bundle.
	 */
	public static function getKey () : string
	{
		return "button";
	}

	/**
	 * Configures the structure for the component
	 */
	protected function configureFields () : array
	{
		return [
			"label" => (new TextField("Label"))
				->enableValidation(),
			"link" => (new LinkField(
				"Link",
				allowEmailLinks: false,
				allowAssetLinks: false,
				allowAnchors: true,
			)),
		];
	}

	/**
	 * Returns whether this component is standalone / nested / universal.
	 */
	protected function getComponentType () : ComponentType
	{
		return ComponentType::Nested;
	}

	/**
	 * Defines the label that is shown in Storybloks UI.
	 */
	public function getDisplayName () : string
	{
		return "Button";
	}
}
```

This is the basic structure of a component. You need to define a unique key, a label for Storybloks UI, the type and the fields.
That's it, you are ready to use this component in Storyblok, [after you synced it](../cli).

See the [fields docs](fields) for an overview over all available fields.


### Additional Settings

Besides of the required methods, you can override default settings, to customize your component.

#### `configureComponent()`

Customize the component definition. Let's you define the preview in the component selector, a custom icon or the background color.


#### `getComponentGroup()`

Returns the component group. You should define a project-wide backed enum that defines all your available component groups and return it.

:::caution
This should only be used to improve the readability in the component admin in Storyblok.
For everything feature related, you should always use component tags instead.
:::


#### `getTags()`

Returns the tags of this component. See the [tags docs](tags) for details.


#### `getStoryClass()`

If the component is a document, and you want to fetch it via the API, you need to create a story for it.
See below for details.


## Fetching Stories

Documents can be fetched as separate entries via the API, while bloks can't – they are only embedded in other components.

When loading content from Storyblok, the data from Storyblok is validated and parsed according to the structure defined in the component definition.
If the data is valid, it will create a `Story` object to be used in the rest of the app.

:::note
The process of validating the data, creating the story and passing the data in, is called **hydration**.
:::

So for every document (that you want to fetch via the API), you need to create a story class.
The simplest possible story class looks like that:


```php
use Torr\Storyblok\Story\Story;

class PageStory extends Story
{
}
```

You need to tell the library which story your component uses, by configuring it in the component:

```php
use Torr\Storyblok\Component\AbstractComponent;

class PageComponent extends AbstractComponent
{
	// ...

	public function getStoryClass () : ?string
	{
		return PageStory::class;
	}
}
```

Right now, the only place that knows the data for the structure of the data that is coming from Storyblok
is the component. The rest of the app should not need to know the structure inside `data` array.
So the Story can provide typed convenience wrappers for the data:


```php
class PageStory extends Story
{
	public function getTitle () : string
	{
		return $this->data["title"];
	}
}
```

In this case, we know that there must be a field called `title`, it is a text and is not optional.

:::tip
By creating story objects, the rest of the app can interact with properly documented and type value objects, instead of an opaque array.
:::


### Transforming Nested Data

You can either directly access the entry in the `data` array as described above, but some of the fields need a transformation of the
data.

:::info
Some of the field types wrap the array structure from Storyblok in value objects or clean up the data.
:::

You can be safe by always transforming the value of the data entries:


```php
class PageStory extends Story
{
	public function getContent () : array
	{
		return $this->getTransformedFieldData("content");
		//                                     ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
		// The argument to this function is the key in the data array.
	}
}
```
