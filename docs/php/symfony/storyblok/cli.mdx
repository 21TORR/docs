# CLI

To integrate your local definitions with Storyblok, you need to push your config to their API.
There are ready-to-use commands for that.

Call the command via:

```bash
bin/console storyblok:*
```

## `storyblok:components:overview`

Renders an overview of all locally registered components, their names and components + stories.

It also renders a list of all components configured in Storyblok that don't match a local definition.

:::tip
If you have manually managed components in Storyblok, you can ignore them in this overview.

However, renamed components are not automatically removed in Storyblok, so this command is great to see if there is something to clean up.
:::


## `storyblok:definitions:sync`

Pushes your local component definitions to Storyblok.

By default, you are asked to confirm to sync the structure.

You can pass `--force` to automatically confirm the command. This can be used to automate your deployment.
