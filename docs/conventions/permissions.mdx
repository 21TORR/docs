# Permissions

Any system that uses authentication, regularly uses permission based access control.

We typically separate this into two different systems:


## Abilities

Abilities are actions inside your app, that need to be checked.

By convention, abilities are written in screaming snake case and start with `CAN_`.

Examples:

- `CAN_EDIT_PROJECTS`
- `CAN_ACCESS_ADMIN`
- `CAN_REMOVE_USERS`

:::info
The app code **should never** checks for roles, but instead always and only for abilities.

## Roles

Roles are assigned to users, so a users has a set of different roles.

These roles included either other roles or a set of abilities, that are allowed by having this role.

Typically, you can define these relations with a role hierarchy, as is done in Symfony:


```yaml
role_hierarchy:
	ROLE_ADMIN:
		- CAN_ACCESS_ADMIN

	ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN:
		- ROLE_ADMIN
		- CAN_DELETE_STUFF
```
